SPRING FRAMEWORK:

The Spring Framework is an open-source framework for building enterprise applications in Java. It provides comprehensive infrastructure support, making it easier to develop robust and maintainable software. The framework simplifies the development of complex, large-scale applications by promoting good design practices and providing reusable code in the form of libraries.

Key features and components of the Spring Framework include:

INVERSION OF CONTROL (IOC):
Spring promotes the IoC design principle, where the control flow of a program is inverted.
Instead of the application code controlling the flow, the framework itself manages the flow of control.
 This is achieved through dependency injection, where the objects (beans) are injected into the application rather than being created by the application.

DEPENDENCY INJECTION (DI):
Spring uses DI to manage the dependencies between different components in an application.
This helps in creating loosely coupled components, making the application more modular and easier to maintain.

ASPECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING (AOP):
AOP is a programming paradigm that allows developers to modularize cross-cutting concerns, such as logging, transaction management, and security.
Spring provides AOP support, enabling developers to separate concerns and improve code modularity.

DATA ACCESS:
Spring offers support for various data access technologies, including JDBC (Java Database Connectivity), ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) frameworks like Hibernate, and JPA (Java Persistence API).

TRANSACTION MANAGEMENT:
Spring simplifies transaction management in Java applications, providing a consistent programming model for handling transactions across different transactional resources like databases.

MODEL-VIEW-CONTROLLER (MVC):
Spring MVC is a web module within the Spring Framework that follows the MVC architectural pattern. It provides a robust framework for building web applications and RESTful services.

SECURITY:
Spring Security is a module that provides comprehensive security services for Java EE-based enterprise software applications.
It covers authentication, authorization, and protection against common security vulnerabilities.

CONTAINER:
The Spring container is responsible for managing the lifecycle of Spring beans.
It is also known as the IoC container and provides various services, such as dependency injection and bean lifecycle management.

INTEGRATION:
Spring supports integration with other frameworks and technologies, making it suitable for use in diverse enterprise environments.
It integrates with technologies like Java EE, JMS (Java Message Service), JMX (Java Management Extensions), and more.

The Spring Framework is widely used in enterprise application development due to its flexibility, modularity, and ability to simplify the development of complex systems.
It is a popular choice for building scalable and maintainable Java applications.

WHAT IS SPRING BEAN ?

Spring bean is an object that is managed by the Spring IoC (Inversion of Control) container.
The Spring container is responsible for instantiating, configuring, and managing these beans throughout their lifecycle.

What is concurrent HashMap And HashTable?


WHAT IS THREAD SAFE  ?

When a thread is already working on an object and preventing another thread on working on the same object, this process is called Thread-Safety.

WHAT IS THROW AND THROWS ?

The 'throw' keyword is used to explicitly throw an exception from within a block of code or a method.
The 'throws' keyword is used in the method signature to declare the exceptions that a method can potentially throw.

THREAD SAFETY AND HOW TO ACHIEVE IT IN JAVA:

As we know Java has a feature, Multithreading, which is a process of running multiple threads simultaneously.
 When multiple threads are working on the same data, and the value of our data is changing, that scenario is not thread-safe and we will get inconsistent results.
 When a thread is already working on an object and preventing another thread on working on the same object, this process is called Thread-Safety.

 HOW TO ACHIEVE THREAD SAFETY
There are four ways to achieve Thread Safety in Java. These are:

Using Synchronization.
Using Volatile Keyword.
Using Atomic Variable.
Using Final Keyword.

USING SYNCHRONIZATION:

Synchronization is the process of allowing only one thread at a time to complete the particular task.
It means when multiple threads executing simultaneously, and want to access the same resource at the same time, then the problem of inconsistency will occur.
so synchronization is used to resolve inconsistency problem by allowing only one thread at a time.
Synchronization uses a synchronized keyword. Synchronized is the modifier that creates a block of code known as a critical section.

Note: Example is there in intellij Idea using Synchronizing -Naresh-java-workspace/Java-coding-practice.

WHAT IS SYNCHRONIZATION AND ASYNCHRONIZATION IN JAVA ?

Asynchronous is a non-blocking architecture, so the execution of one task isn't dependent on another.
Tasks can run simultaneously. Synchronous is a blocking architecture, so the execution of each operation depends on completing the one before it.
Each task requires an answer before moving on to the next iteration.

COLLECTIONS FRAMEWORK:
List:
1.List is a interface which extends from collection interface.
2.In list we can store elements in seqential order.
3.List allow duplicate elements.
4.In list, elements are maintanied by index positions because it uses index based structure.
5.While we retriving the elements insertion order is maintanied.
6.It allows for storing many null elements.
7.List interface in java has four concrete subclasses.
 They are ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector, and Stack.
 These four subclasses implements the list interface.

ArrayList:
1.ArrayList is a class which implements from List Interface.
2.ArrayList can store elements in index based structure.
3.Arraylist maintained insertion order.
4.An ArrayList is a resizable array that can grow or shrink in the memory whenever needed.
5.ArrayList class is present in the java.util package and is commonly used for storing and manipulating collections of objects in an arbitrary order.
6.ArrayList is not synchronized. That means multiple threads can use the same ArrayList objects simultaneously.

WHAT IS ITERATOR IN JAVA ?

1. Iterator in java is a special type of object that provides seqential access to the elements of collection object.
2.An Iterator object implements Iterator interface which is present in java.util.Iterator package.
3.By using Iterator, we can perform both read and remove operations.

WHAT IS ITERABLE INTERFACE IN JAVA ?
1.The Collection interface extends Iterable interface that is present at the top of the collection hierarchy.
2.The iterable interface is present in java.lang.Iterable package.
3.It provides a uniform way to retrieve the elements one by one from a collection object.

DRAWBACKS OF ITERATOR ?
1.By using Iterator, we can move only towards forwarding direction.
We cannot move in the backward direction. Hence, these are called single-direction cursors.
2.We can perform either read operation or remove operation.
3.We cannot perform the replacement of new objects.
4.For example, suppose there are five mangoes in a box.
 Out of five, two mangoes are not good but we cannot replace those damaged mangos with new mangos.
  To overcome the above drawbacks, we should use the ListIterator concept.

WHAT IS LISTOPERATOR IN JAVA ?
1.ListIterator is an interface (an extension of Iterator interface) in Java that is used to retrieve elements from a collection object in both forward and reverse directions.
2.By using ListIterator, we can perform different kinds of operations such as read, remove, replacement (current object), and the addition of new elements from a list while iterating.

WHAT IS RUNNABLE INTERFACE ?
1. Runnable interface is a interface.
2.The Runnable interface should be implemented by any class whose instances are intended to be executed by a thread.
3.The class must define a method of no arguments called run.

WHAT IS CALLABLE INTERFACE ?
1.Callable Interface is a Interface.
2.Callable is interface is provided by the java.util.concurrentpackage.
3.Callable Interface in java is used to make class instance run as a thread by implementing it.
4.Callable interface can return any object as result and can throw an exception.

WHAT IS MARKER INTERFACE ?
1.An interface that does not contain methods, fields, and constants is known as marker interface.
2.In other words, an empty interface is known as marker interface or tag interface.
3.It delivers the run-time type information about an object.
4.It is the reason that the JVM and compiler have additional information about an object.
5.The Serializable and Cloneable interfaces are the example of marker interface.

WHAT IS ClONEABLE INTERFACE ?
1.Cloneable interface in Java is a marker interface that is used to indicate that a class can be cloned.
2.It is an empty interface that does not contain any methods to implement.
3.By convention, a class that implements the Cloneable interface is expected to override the Object.

WHAT IS SERILIZABLE INTERFACE ?
1.It is a marker interface in Java that is defined in the java.io package.
2.If we want to make the class serializable, we must implement the Serializable interface.
3.If a class implements the Serializable interface, we can serialize or deserialize the state of an object of that class.

WHAT IS SERILIZATION AND DESERILIZATION ?
SERILIZATION:
1.Serialization (converting object into byte stream ) is mechanisam in which object state is read from the memory and written into a file or database.

DESERIALIZATION:
2. Deserialization (converting byte stream into object ) is opposite of serialization means object state reading from the file or database and written
   back to the memory.

WHAT IS COMPARATOR INTERFACE ?
1.Comparator is a interface in java
2. Comparator interface is used to sorting the objects of user defined class.
3.It provides multiple sorting sequences, i.e., you can sort the elements on the basis of any data member, for example, rollno, name, age or anything else.
4.This interface is found in java.util package and contains 2 methods compare(Object obj1,Object obj2) and equals(Object element).

WHAT IS COMPARABLE INTERFACE ?
1. Comaparable is a interface.
2. Comparable interface is used to order the objects of user-defined class.
3. This interface is found in java.lang package.
4. And it contains only one method i.e, compareTo(Object)
5.It provides a single sorting sequence only, i.e., you can sort the elements on the basis of single data member only.
For example, it may be rollno, name, age or anything else.
